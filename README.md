# QuantumProject

This project was an exploration of quantum computing, culminating in the project finally being run on one of IBM's actual quantum computers.
The idea was to use the game, Mastermind, to demystify the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm. 
It involved using a quantum randomizer and an implementation of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, split into two parts (encoder/the rest)

In the end, the project did run on a quantum computer, but there was an error at the end integrating that data back into the project. 
Luckily, that was the last calculation, and the final part was display, so sadly rather than ending with a pretty histogram, it ended with an error message and an outcome in my IBM account, but there WAS an outcome!

(the code was 1000)
